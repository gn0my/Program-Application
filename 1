#0) Write a function that takes the list of integers as an argument and returns the product of all of them

def product(list1):
  sum = 1
  for value in list1:
    sum *= value
  return sum

#1) Write a function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all of the even values
def sum_even(list1):
  sum = 0
  for value in list1:
    if value%2 == 0:
      sum += value
  return sum
#2) Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string. If there are multiple long strings, return the one that occurs first in the list.
def long_str(list1):
  longer_str = list1[0]
  for value in list1[1:-1:1]:
    if len(longer_str) < len(value):
      longer_str = value
  return longer_str
#3) Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the one with the most vowels. If there are multiple strings with the most vowels, return the one that occurs last in the list.
def most_vowel(list1):
  most_vowel = list1[0]
  for value in list1:
    if most_vowel.count() < value.count(vowel):
      most_vowel = value
  return most_vowel
